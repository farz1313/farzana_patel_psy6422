# Final Self-assessment for PSY6422

## 1. Which topic did I find most useful or interesting? Explain why
I found the data management and version control the most useful. I always had issues with repeated codes for a long time. I was pleasantly surprised to learn the techniques to prevent the heartburn of finding the recent code. I liked how intuitive it was to catch the stacked layered approach followed the code. It was easy to learn and follow the flow of functions. 

## 2. Which topic did I find least useful, interesting or most difficult? Explain why
I didnâ€™t find any topic difficult to follow honestly. However, I would have found it really useful to see a detailed git merges and cloning of codebooks live to follow the changes. 

## 3. What topics do I want to learn more about in the future? Explain why
I would like to learn more about animated plots and how to use multiple languages in RStudio. I liked the way animated plots tell a story. 
I would personally like to learn a little more feature of R that support data science techniques.

## 4. Please share one thing you have read and enjoyed or found useful on the topic of data management and/or visualisation
I have found the entire module really enjoyable. I found project organization the most useful. I make it a point to put in the initial efforts to follow the steps in order to avoid redoing mending inconsistencies later.
